Big O Notation:
    Direct Way how to find Big O.
        - Ignore lower order terms
        - Ignore Leading term constant

3n^2 + 5n + 6       - O(n^2)
3n + 10nlogn + 3     - O(nlogn)
10n^3 + 40n + 10    - O(n^3) 

Whenever we talk about Asymptotic Notation we talk about large number of n values or value.

Defination: f(n) = O(g(n)) iff there exist constants c and n.
            such that f(n) <= c * g(n) for all n >= n0. 

Example:
    f(n) = 2n + 3
    can be written as O(n) [g(n) = n]
    Let's take c = 3        // trick to find c is coffe. of highest growing term and add 1 so 2+1
    2n + 3 <= 3n
    3 <= n
    we get n0 = 3

Big O Notation works for Multiple Variables also:
    100n^2 + 1000m + n : O(n^2 + m)
    1000m^2 200mn + 30m + 20n : O(m^2 + mn)


Applications:
    Used when we have an upper bound.
